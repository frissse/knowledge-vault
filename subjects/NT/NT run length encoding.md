a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (consecutive occurrences of the same data value) are stored as a single occurrence of that data value and a count of its consecutive occurrences, rather than as the original run

as an imaginary example of the concept, when encoding an image built up from colored dots, the sequence "green green green green green green green green green" is shortened to "green x 9".
