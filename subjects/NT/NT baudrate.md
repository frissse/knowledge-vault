[[NT Networking MOC]]

one of the components that determine the speed of communication over a data channel.

the unit for symbol rate or modulation rate in symbols per second or pulses per second

it is the number of distinct symbol changes (signalling events) made to the transmission medium per second in a digitally modulated signal or a bd rate line code

if there are precisely two symbols in the system (typically 0 and 1), then baud and bits per second are equivalent
