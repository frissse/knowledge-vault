[[NT Networking MOC]]

alternative for [[NT packet switching|packet switching]]

- a dedicated communication path is established between 2 endpoints 
- this path is reserver for the entire duration of the data transmission
	- even when no data is being transmitted the connection stays open
- data arrives in sequence at the destination with minimum delay
- inefficient use of bandwidth
- suitable for continous dat astreams like voice calls
- very reliable once established
