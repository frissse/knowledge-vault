par tof network segmentation to define different security zones within a network

**Purpose**: Red LANs are usually associated with high-risk, untrusted, or external network zones.
**Network Type**: Often, a Red LAN is where unfiltered or external traffic enters, such as from the internet, potentially exposing the network to security threats.
**Security Level**: This zone tends to have stricter monitoring and is seen as insecure or untrusted.
**Usage Examples**:
    - Network environments that interface with the internet (e.g., DMZ – Demilitarized Zone).
    - Guest networks.
	- Untrusted devices or external vendor connections.
