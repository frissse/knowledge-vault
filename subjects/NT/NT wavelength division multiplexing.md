[[NT Networking MOC]]

a multiplexing technique used in optical communication, where multiple data streams are transmitted simultaneously over a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths (or colors) of light

each wavelength is acting as a seperate channel

types of WDM:
- coarse WDM: max 8 kanalen
- dense WDM: 16 kanalen (160Gbit/s)
