[wikipedia](ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)

a [network architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_architecture "Network architecture") for virtually extending a [private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network "Private network") (
i.e. any [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") which is not the public [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet")) 
across one or multiple other networks which are either untrusted (as they are not controlled by the entity 
aiming to implement the VPN) or need to be isolated (thus making the lower network invisible or not directly usable)
