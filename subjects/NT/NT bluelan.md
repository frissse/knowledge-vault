[[NT Networking MOC]]

**Purpose**: Blue LANs generally refer to a more secure, trusted network environment.
**Network Type**: This network segment is meant for internal use, with trusted devices and users.
**Security Level**: Often, it has stricter access controls and internal communication flows. Traffic in this segment is trusted and typically shielded from external networks (like the Red LAN).
**Usage Examples**:
- Internal company networks.
- Segments for trusted internal applications and services.
- Local Area Networks (LAN) that are not exposed to public-facing services.
