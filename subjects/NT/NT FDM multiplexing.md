[[NT Networking MOC]]

technique used in telecommunications and signal processing to transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel or medium, such as a cable or radio spectrum

each signal is assigned a specific frequency band within the overall bandwidth allowing them to coexist without interference

All signals are transmitted simultaneously, but each occupies its distinct frequency range.

At the receiver end, filters and demodulators separate the signals based on their carrier frequencies, retrieving the original data for each one.

guard bands are used between the frequencies ranges to prevent interference
