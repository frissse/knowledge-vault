another purpose of modulation is to transmit multiple channels of information through a single communication medium, using [[NT FDM multiplexing]]

a modulator is a device or circuit that performs modulation. A demodulator (sometimes detector) is a circuit that performs demodulation, the inverse of modulation. 

a modem (from modulatorâ€“demodulator), used in bidirectional communication, can perform both operations.
