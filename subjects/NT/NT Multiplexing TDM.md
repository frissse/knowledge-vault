[[NT Networking MOC]]

a digital or analog technique used to transmit multiple signals over a single communication channel by dividing the available time into separate intervals or time slots

Each signal gets access to the entire channel, but only for a specific portion of time, allowing multiple signals to share the same transmission medium efficiently.
