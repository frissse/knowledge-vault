alias: QAM 
definition:  a technique used in telecommunications to transmit data by modulating both the amplitude of two carrier waves, which are out of phase by 90 degrees (hence "quadrature")
type: technology
port: N/A
OSI-layer: physical

= quadrature amplitude modulation

quadrature means that the difference in 2 carriers is 90 degrees
this allows to transmit multiple signals over a single carrier

in 16 bit QAM the diagram of possible signals look like this
this way it is possible to transmit 16 possible different signals

advantages of QAM
- noise immunity
- low probability of error value
- supports a high data rate
- QAM doubles the effective bandwidth


QAM is used in radio transmission, WiFi and cellular transmissions
