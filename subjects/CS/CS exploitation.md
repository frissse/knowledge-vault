general hacking mechanisms in a methodical approach
- password cracking
	- types of password cracking
		- Dictionary Attacks - dictionary files of password used to find a matching password
		- Brute-Force Attacks - every possible combination is attemped until a match is found
		- Hybrid Attack - builds on the dictionary style attack with extra additions like using special characters
		- Syllable Attack - combo of brute force and dictionary attack
		- Rule-Based Attack - based on knowledge about the target of phrases and things he might use to create the password
		- Passive Online Attacks - 
		- Active Online Attacks
		- Offline Attacks
		- Nontechnical Attacks
	not considered real cracking, cracking is usually done offline with a compromised hash
	- passive online attacks
		- packet sniffing
			- capturing packets
			- difficult with todays switches
				- solution: retrieve from end device
				- can still be done with wireless
				- switch attacking ▶ make it behave like a hub ▶ forwarding packets through all ports
					- can be done through mac flooding: letting the switch's mac tables grow in size with fake mac addresses
		- man in the middle
			- eavesdropping
			- can be used for information gathering
			- from spoofing to MITM attack
				- [[NT ARP]] spoofing (layer 2)
				- send frames so the traffic gets redirected through your device
				- listen in, get the packets and redirect them to the right destination
				- afterwards put ARP back to normal to erase traces
		- replay
			- resending packets with password for authentication
			- hacker receives the authentication responses
	- active online attacks
		- guessing
		- trojan, spyware, keylogger
		- hash injection
		- hashing?
			- a form of one way encryption that is used to verify integrity
			- to log in the client's hash is compared with that on the server, if these matche the user is allowed to login
		- rainbow tables
			- rainbow tables compute the hash of every possible combination of a set of characters
			- then the attacker can use the tabel trying to guess the password
			- it is possible that a hash matches more than one password
				- to prevent this a salt is used: a random string as an extra layer for the password encryption
- privilege escalation
	- horizontal privilege escalation
		- taking over the rights and privileges from another user with same privileges as current user
	- vertical privilege escalation
		- taking over an account to has more rights and privileges than the current account being used
- executing applications
	- backdoors
		- allowing lateer access to the system
		- can come in the form of rootkits, trojan horse,...
	- crackers
		- has the ability to crack code or obtain passwords
	- keyloggers
		- logging what is being put in through a keyboard
	- malware
		- a more general collection of software designed to collect information
			- virus
			- worms
			- trojans
			- hybrids
- hiding files, covering tracks and concealing evidence
	- prevent discovery
	- disable auditing
	- eliminate error messages
	- clean log files
- expand the attack
	- expanding the attack to more systems in the network
frameworks
- different frameworks in differens steps of the attack
	- reconnaiance
	- scanning
	- vulnerability
	- hacking/explouit
- example: [[,metasploit]]
	- written in Ruby
