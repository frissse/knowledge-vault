before AI there was big data analysis breakthrough
before big data there was the big spending of VC for every app that was trying to implement crypto
before crypto Web 2.0 was a thing
and before that there was the dotcombubble

the discours used is usually the same "no aspect of our lives that is not going to be affected"
"there is a lot of data about people that allows us to understand them better, with big data we can do this"

the discour usually goes in two directions, first it can change the world, second it might be a danger and it needs to be put in good hands to keep it check
usually a person who says this means that the technology is in good hands when his company is running it
so they put fear on the public, because it spreads the fastest, while at the same time claiming that their company is in the forefront of the innovation and they have the product of choice`
