why do you care about online privacy?

primarily don't want to be a data point. I don't want by personal information to predict how X demographic will react to Y advertising. I also believe that privacy is one of the main pillars of democracy and freedom (mostly since you can influence voting behaviour if you have enough data about enough people).
