[[MT Quote]]
[[IT online privacy]]

"i have nothing to hide, I also have nothing to share with you"
Eric Murphy, youTuber, [link](https://inv.nadeko.net/watch?v=H414XdcbC4Q)

"eventually the internet is built around a bargain, you can visit a website for free while they track what you are doing on that website and use that data to their benefit"

"Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance."
Daniel J. Solove

"privacy eventually is not about secrecy and what information you give away, but more about how that information is used and what say you got in that usage of your data"
